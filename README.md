# Features 
While preserving the minimal design of mymizu we kept the UI simple. Implementing the log refill button
and the check milestone button. Along with this there is a carousel which will display selected achievements once
reached. 

The check milestone button directs to the milestones page. This is where the organized achievements can be seen.
There is also a home button to navigate to the home page.
